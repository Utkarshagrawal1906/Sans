  <h1>Privacy Policy for Sanskrit Dictionary App</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: September 11, 2025</p>

  <p>At U-Solutions, your privacy is our top priority. The Sanskrit Dictionary app is designed to assist students, educators, and professionals in learning Sanskrit â€” without compromising your privacy.</p>

  <h2>1. No Personal Information Collected</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). You can use the app freely with no sign-up or login required.</p>

  <h2>2. No Ads, No Trackers</h2>
  <p>The app is entirely ad-free. We do not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools of any kind.</p>

  <h2>3. Read-Only Data Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The app fetches Sanskrit word meanings from a public GitHub repository.</li>
    <li>This is strictly read-only; the app does not upload or send any data to GitHub.</li>
    <li>GitHub is only used as a storage source for dictionary content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Use of Google Gemini API</h2>
  <p>The app integrates the Google Gemini API for sentence generation and enhanced word meaning search.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal information is shared with Google.</li>
    <li>Only the search text or input word provided by the user is sent to the API to generate the requested result.</li>
    <li>This request is processed securely and used solely to provide functionality inside the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. No Access to Device Data</h2>
  <p>We do not access or use any device-specific information such as location, contacts, device ID, or storage beyond what is required to run the app locally.</p>

  <h2>6. Safe for Children</h2>
  <p>This app is suitable for children and complies with child privacy regulations. Since we do not collect personal data, the app is safe for all age groups.</p>

  <h2>7. Local-Only Storage</h2>
  <p>All downloaded content is stored locally on your device. You can clear this data at any time through device settings or by uninstalling the app.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be shared within the app or through official communication channels.</p>
